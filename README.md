# Prevalence Mapping for Cancer in WA State
Name: **Walker Azam**

*STAT/CSSS 554*

*Instructor: Dr. John Wakefield (UW Dept. of Biostatistics)*



## Project Background
In this project I will be  mapping and predicting Cancer risk in Washington state at a census tract level. This will be done primarily in the ``R`` coding language, using standard packages for spatial analysis such as ``SUMMER``.

As noted by the Cancer Statistics Center from teh American Cancer Society, there are over 441 incident cases for cancer per 100,000 people living in Washington State, 2015-2019, and an estimated 44,630 new cases for 2023. In an effort to better understand possible environmental covariate factors of cancer rates in the state, and possibly inform resource allocation and plan interventions, I would like to perform disease mapping based on exposure covariates. Personal exposure information such as individuals' diets, genetics, or smoking habits will not be considered. Rather the purpose of the project is to understand if there are environmental risk exposures such as Air Quality, or harmful chemical exposures that may have an effect on Cancer risk. Moreover, the project will aim to highlight whether particular areas in Washington state are at high risk for cancer, which can result in more specific future studies to elucidate any potential reasons and interventions.
